      <ul>
        <li><strong>a) HTML</strong> <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is a markup language used
          to define webpages and their content.</li>
        <li><strong>b) CSS</strong>: <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em> is a way of defining a style
          and look of a webpage. It's used to overwrite the <em>user agent stylesheet</em>          with your own.</li>
        <li><strong>c) JavaScript</strong>: Command language used to add dynamic content to web
          pages. Also there are JS based APIs such as jQuery that are used to mimiq server
          side functionality on the client device and to add pre-made ready to use functionality
          to JS.</li>
        <li><strong>d) HTTP</strong>: <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> is a data transfer protocol
          used in the internet. It uses hyperlinks between nodes to transfer hypertext data.</li>
        <li><strong>e) HMTL5</strong>: Markup language for displaying and structuring content in
          the world wide web. The HTML5 specification was published in 2014 by the World Wide
          Web Consortium, W3C.</li>
        <li><strong>f) Dynamic HTML</strong>: Is a term used for a collection of technologies used
          to create interactive websites. These technologies include things such as HTML, JS,
          CSS and DOM.</li>

      <h3>Lab 1.2 Coding conventions</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Naming</strong>: name the files, functions, classes etc. in the same manner
          consistently, so you or the next author of the code will have an easier time reading
          and understanding your code. </li>
        <li><strong>Commenting</strong>: Comment your code in a meaningful manner that it provides
          "
          <em>value</em>" and needed information. For example if you have a bug or a workaround
          in the code and you don't comment on it, couple months down the line when you come
          back to it and spend the same amount of time trying to resolve it and coming down
          the same conclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Formatting &amp; style</strong>: Format your code in a sensible matter. If
          you're the original author of the code, you can define the way of formatting and
          the rest should follow it. If you work in a company, follow the company formatting
          policy.

    <div class="cEA p4">
      <b>What is the purpose of the RWD? Why it is used? How things are done before RWD? What is the difference?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The purpose of responsive web design is to be able to make websites that can dynamically
        adjust to the screensize and orientation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before RWD, websites used to have a separate desktop and mobile site, which led to an
        inconsistent style and functionality, but since the ability to create RWD websites,
        increased computing performance of devices, browser compability and increased screen
        sizes, we've been able to make one website that can adapt to all screensizes and still
        maintain all or most of the functionality.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>How css media queries can help you building responsive web sites?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Media queries can get the size of the screen or device, so the website can scale and
        adapt to different sizes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cEE p4">
      <b>Why to use em (font) based sizing for example margins?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>em-sizing scales with the font, so if you want a margin or a gap that is twice the size
        of the current font, you can simply use "2em".</p>

      <b>Article is already 7 years old, do we have any new technology which can
        be used to achieve same type of UI responsiveness as described in the article. Buzz words: (CSS Grid, Flexbox)</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Nowadays we have multiple technologoies that can help us build responsive web sites.
        CSS Grid allows for two dimensional layouting of a website while in the past we could
        only define it one dimensionally (ie. start building from the top or one of the sides
        with divs and floats.).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Flexbox is a container with child elements and it allows for aligning items (CENTERING!!!),
        pushing them to one or multiple direction (think of a split nav bar) and so on. The
        nav bar on this site uses flexbox. </p>

      <b>HTML5 specification introduces new semantic elements. One of them is a figure element. Can you say why you should use it in addition to standard img elements?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Before HTML5 semantic markup elements, we didn't have a way to mark up diagrams, images,
        illustrations etc. Now with the figure tag, we can caption elements without having
        to resort to CSS classes or other tricks.</p>

      <b>What can you do with jQuery?</b>
      <p>jQuery makes it easier to do DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation. It can
        be used to create animations, handle events and develop Ajax applications.</p>
      <br>
      <b>How it can help as a web developer?</b>
      <p>jQuery makes common tasks much simpler to do compared to using just plain JavScript.
        It has a lot of built-in functionality such as Ajax features, JSON parsin and DOM manipulation.</p>
      <br>
      <b>If you think our earlier participant list app, in what kind of issues you could use
        jQuery?</b>
      <br>

      <b>What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Content delivery networks are networks that you can store your common elements, libraries
        and other content.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduces the load on your server since the content is retrieved from the CDN server instead
          of your own</li>
        <li>Possibly faster, since CDN server are distributed all over the globe, so if your server
          is located in Finland, a person in the US still has a CDN server nearby with the
          content
        </li>
        <li>Browsers cache common frameworks and scripts, so things like jQuery</li>
